/**
 * A Route is a path that traverses arbitrary GeoSegments, regardless
 * of their names.
 * <p>
 * Routes are immutable. New Routes can be constructed by adding a segment 
 * to the end of a Route. An added segment must be properly oriented; that 
 * is, its p1 field must correspond to the end of the original Route, and
 * its p2 field corresponds to the end of the new Route.
 * <p>
 * Because a Route is not necessarily straight, its length - the distance
 * traveled by following the path from start to end - is not necessarily
 * the same as the distance along a straight line between its endpoints.
 * <p>
 * Lastly, a Route may be viewed as a sequence of geographical features,
 * using the <tt>getGeoFeatures()</tt> method which returns an Iterator of
 * GeoFeature objects.
 * <p>
 * <b>The following fields are used in the specification:</b>
 * <pre>
 *   start : GeoPoint            // location of the start of the route
 *   end : GeoPoint              // location of the end of the route
 *   startHeading : angle        // direction of travel at the start of the route, in degrees
 *   endHeading : angle          // direction of travel at the end of the route, in degrees
 *   geoFeatures : sequence      // a sequence of geographic features that make up this Route
 *   geoSegments : sequence      // a sequence of segments that make up this Route
 *   length : real               // total length of the route, in kilometers
 *   endingGeoSegment : GeoSegment  // last GeoSegment of the route
 * </pre>
